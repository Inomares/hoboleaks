		<td width="355px">The Standup Cynosural System Jammer is a service module that prevents the activation of standard Cynosural Field Generator modules within an entire star system. Activating this module begins a 5 minute warmup period during which capsuleers within the system will be able to detect that a cynosural jamming effect is imminent. Once the 5 minute period is complete all standard Cynosural Field Generator modules will be unable to begin new cycles of operation.
