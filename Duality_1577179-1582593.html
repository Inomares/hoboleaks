		<td style="max-width: 400px;">The vast low-lying deltas and marshy plains of Luminaire's Western Morthane region have a long and dark history in folklore and in the ancient warring states period of the Gallente home world's past. Inhabitants on the periphery of the Great Morthani Wastes have many legends of spirits of light and flame seen wandering the swamps and several of these are feared as devils and demonic beings.<br><br>The Western Morthani natives called the most-feared of these spirits the "Boitata", and believed it to be a fiery serpent with a penchant for consuming the eyes of the dead and perhaps even the sinful living. Garouni settlers on the far western edge of the Great Wastes called this legendary demon "Malagrin" and also noted the tendency for livestock drowned in the marshes to attract these eery lights.<br><br>Military disaster is also a feature of the history of the Great Morthani Wastes. In its epic campaign to overthrow the ancient slaveholder Empire of Morthane, the Garoun Empire made several attempts to bypass the blistering deserts of Southern Morthane by marching armies through the western swamps. The legions of Garoun failed to penetrate the grim marshlands at every try, giving up on the route after an entire army, wracked by disease and starvation was destroyed by Morthani raiders at the south-eastern edge of the great wastes.<br><br>Some tales are told of lights dancing on the corpses of the lost soldiers of Garoun and this has become part of the Malagrin and Boitata legends on either side of the vast swamps.</td>

		<td style="max-width: 400px;">The Grand Teigjon Resort & Casino in Vellaine has been the prime venue for Interstellar Mind Clash Championships for many years and will host the 99th Worlds Championships in October YC121. The event is being heavily promoted by the Grand Teigjon as an "All-Stars Casino Clash" with the likes of Zirud "Black Dragon" Mikkela, Parvir "Flame Dancer" an-Zoar, Nadia "Silver Bear" Tanaka, and Joelyn "Blue Tiger" Donalokos vying for the coveted Worlds Champion title.<br><br>The Echelon Entertainment Station in Vellaine has long been a magnet for Mind Clash fans due to the presence of the prestigious Grand Teigjon Resort at the heart of the station's large leisure district. Even when major championships are not being hosted, there is an active Mind Clash circuit and numerous conventions and exhibition matches are often being held there.<br><br>Capsuleers are a significant demographic among the most dedicated Mind Clash fans, finding the complex, mentally-demanding neuro-holographic game endlessly entertaining. Naturally, for Echelon Entertainment, the attendance of large numbers of capsuleers at the Worlds Championships is always welcome due to their huge spending power.</td>
