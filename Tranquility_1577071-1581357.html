		<td style="max-width: 400px;">This vessel is a special variant of the Leshak, a very heavy and well-armed warship that is clearly the Collective's frontline battleship. The Chislov Leshak variant has been seen deploying auto-assembling Triglavian structures in close proximity to stellar bodies and is suspected to belong to a special sub-group within the Triglavian Collective. Presumably, like others of its class, the Chislov Leshak  variant is capable of mounting Supratidal Entropic Disintegrators and an array of support weapons.<br><br><i>Leshak Subclade of Veles Clade scattered the adaptation schema of reverse-time reclaimed adapation schema of 729 tactical troika classification vessel into the cladeflow without proving after Convocation of Triglav Outside the Struggle. Convocations of the Commune Troika have now-time pressure for dispersal to strategic troika.</i> – partial translation of data included in recovered design schematics of the Leshak</td>

		<td style="max-width: 400px;">This Triglavian installation appears to be manipulating the local spatio-temporal topology of the system's central star in order to use it as a vast ultra high-energy particle accelerator, causing numerous strange effects across the entire star system. The structure itself is functioning as the control nexus for whatever bizarre experiment is being carried out by the Triglavian Collective around the star.<br><br>Once fully operational, and manipulating local space-time, the installation's operations will cause ripples of spatio-temporal distortion to spread out from the central star. Consequent effects that will be experienced in the system include:<br><br><b>Increase</b> in turret tracking speed by <b>15%</b><br><br><b>Increase</b> in missile explosion velocity by <b>15%</b><br><br><b>Increase</b> in mining speed by <b>10%</b><br><br><b>Decrease</b> in warp speed by <b>30%</b><br><br>Quantum interactions similar to Triglavian space-time filament and conduit technology have been detected, and it is possible that the Collective are engaged in an effort to "weave" the star's gravity well into their conduit network. The prospect of the Triglavians incorporating the system into their domains cannot be ruled out and merits forceful counter-action by New Eden's defenders.</td>

		<td style="max-width: 400px;">In the icy climes of the Northern Mikramurka on Matar there are many traditional forms of transport that take advantage of the snow and ice fields to be found there. One of the most celebrated is still found as a traditional sport around the seismically active western interior of that region.<br><br>The "bladeracer" sled competitions are usually held on the relatively gentle slopes of the dormant shield volcanoes typically found in the area. The climate means that the upper reaches of the volcanoes are covered in snow and ice all year round but the lower areas remain rather fertile and are warmed by vents. The consequent profusion of heathers and mosses give the hills and slopes their characteristic purple coloration during the "warm" season.</td>

		<td style="max-width: 400px;">In the icy climes of the Northern Mikramurka on Matar there are many traditional forms of transport that take advantage of the snow and ice fields to be found there. One of the most celebrated is still found as a traditional sport around the seismically active western interior of that region.<br><br>The "bladeracer" sled competitions are usually held on the relatively gentle slopes of the dormant shield volcanoes typically found in the area. The climate means that the upper reaches of the volcanoes are covered in snow and ice all year round but the lower areas remain rather fertile and are warmed by vents. The consequent profusion of heathers and mosses give the hills and slopes their characteristic purple coloration during the "warm" season.</td>

		<td style="max-width: 400px;">In the icy climes of the Northern Mikramurka on Matar there are many traditional forms of transport that take advantage of the snow and ice fields to be found there. One of the most celebrated is still found as a traditional sport around the seismically active western interior of that region.<br><br>The "bladeracer" sled competitions are usually held on the relatively gentle slopes of the dormant shield volcanoes typically found in the area. The climate means that the upper reaches of the volcanoes are covered in snow and ice all year round but the lower areas remain rather fertile and are warmed by vents. The consequent profusion of heathers and mosses give the hills and slopes their characteristic purple coloration during the "warm" season.</td>

		<td style="width:355px;">In the icy climes of the Northern Mikramurka on Matar there are many traditional forms of transport that take advantage of the snow and ice fields to be found there. One of the most celebrated is still found as a traditional sport around the seismically active western interior of that region.<br><br>The "bladeracer" sled competitions are usually held on the relatively gentle slopes of the dormant shield volcanoes typically found in the area. The climate means that the upper reaches of the volcanoes are covered in snow and ice all year round but the lower areas remain rather fertile and are warmed by vents. The consequent profusion of heathers and mosses give the hills and slopes their characteristic purple coloration during the "warm" season.</td>
