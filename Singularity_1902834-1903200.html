Complicating the picture is the role of Minmatar circles and certain of the security organizations of the Republic. Many stargates are run by specialized circles, akin to trade guilds, and these are usually so-called "closed circles" from a single clan.

Each stargate is usually crewed by members of a single clan belonging to one of the seven great tribes, according to historical precedents and agreements negotiated between tribes and clans over the gate in question. Complicating the picture is the role of Minmatar circles and certain of the security organizations of the Republic. Many stargates are run by specialized circles, akin to trade guilds, and these are usually so-called "closed circles" from a single clan. Others are "open" and have members from several clans or even tribes. Such circles are useful in the case of stargates claimed by several clans or tribes. The Republic Fleet, RJD and RSS also take a great interest in stargate operations but the larger stargate circles are usually powerful enough to maintain their perquisites and avoid interference by external agencies.

		<td style="width:355px;">The Gallente Federation's stargates are generally operated according to a classic Gallente compromise between competing political, corporate and military interests. Although the federal franchise system would seem to apply to stargates, the role of gates in travel, communications, exploration and security resulted in considerable debate as to which of the key franchises – astromining, shipping, security, or communications – would apply to the gates. Ultimately, the Federation Senate decided that the stargate network was inherently a matter for the Federal Administration, and the Federal Stargate Authority is consequently one of the largest agencies within the Gallente government.
