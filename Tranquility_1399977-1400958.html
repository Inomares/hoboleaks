Despite a number of conflicting stories as to the fate of St. Tetrimon's remains, this is most definitely a fake. A Ministry of Internal Order raid on the marketplace where this reliquary was for sale uncovered fifteen boxes each containing a dozen identical right-hand middle fingerbone relics, all labelled as supposedly from the same saint.</td>

		<td>49641 - <b>Amarr Religious Mask</b></td>
		<td style="max-width: 500px;">Masks have an important role in Amarr society due to their association with God's angelic servants, the sefrim, who wore them so that the people of Amarr would not be struck dead by their great beauty. Plain silver and gold sefrim masks are commonly used in Amarr religious ceremonies to invoke God. Donning a sefrim mask symbolizes the priest's role as an agent of God, investing them with the power and authority to perform their religious duties.<br><br>Outside of ritual, masks are also used as a form of Amarrian heraldry. These masks, decorated with specific colors and iconography according to a strict set of rules, represent Amarrian noble houses, and they are frequently worn at high society affairs.<br><br>Perhaps most in keeping with their original references in Scripture, though, Amarrian masks are sometimes used to hide great beauty or disfigurement in places where it might cause agitation. Some have also noted that masks feature extensively in the rites of extremist cults, such as the Sani Sabik and Equilibrium of Mankind, and a number of designs are listed as heretical in the Theology Council's monumental, multi-volume and highly restricted Codex of Forbidden Iconography and Symbols.</td>

		<td>49644 - <b>Black Dagger</b></td>
		<td style="max-width: 500px;">A black dagger, typically constructed out of obsidian glass or dark iron, is an Amarrian implement used to mark a soul as corrupt. It is used most commonly in criminal sentencing performed by the Theology Council, which has the authority to convict a person accused of crimes against God, the Emperor or the Imperial Rite. The dagger is typically used to carve a symbol into the flesh to denote heretics, apostates, and those struck from the Amarr Book of Records. <br><br>A person marked with a black dagger by the Theology Council courts can never return to the Amarr faith in this world. The best such an excommunicate can hope for, if they have worked to redeem themselves, is mercy from God when they meet their final judgment. When a black dagger is used for executions, Amarr believe that the soul of the sentenced is sent to God bearing what is essentially a note from the executioner declaring that this person is irredeemable.<br><br>Black daggers are not the only ritual weapons used in Amarr. In ceremonies involving purification or atonement, Amarr priests use white-colored implements. Red daggers were once used in the ancient rites of the faith, in ceremonies of symbolic sacrifice and similar such rituals. The association with Sani Sabik heresies involving actual bloodletting has made such usage rare, although certain Sarumite sects continue to use red daggers in ceremonies of martial induction and the like.</td>

		<td>49645 - <b>Tarot of St. Jamyl</b></td>
		<td style="max-width: 500px;">The so-called "Tarot of St. Jamyl" began to circulate at the fringes of the Amarrian faithful not long after the death of Empress Jamyl I. Decks of cards illustrated with religious iconography for use in various rituals have a long, if chequered, history in the Amarr Empire. While many are drawn from traditional Amarr iconography,  a large number of tarot designs are considered heretical or blasphemous. <br><br>The Tarot of St. Jamyl's status is ambiguous as, while extreme Jamylite and Sarumite sects make use of the cards, the association with the heroic figure of Empress Jamyl has stayed the hands of the Ministry of Internal Order or the Theology Council courts so far. However, rumors of Sani Sabik use of this tarot set, coupled with Jamylite excesses, is attracting ever greater scrutiny by the MIO's heretic hunters.</td>

		<td>49647 - <b>Golden Sabik Vial</b></td>
		<td style="max-width: 500px;">These vials, commonly worn around the neck as a pendant, are an important religious item for Sani Sabik adherents, representing the personal development of the wearer's spirit in their journey to becoming an immortal savant. Golden Sabik vials come in a variety of designs, from simple shells to teardrops, hearts (stylized or realistic), or busts of important religious figures. Despite the name, most golden vials are merely gilded. Only the most extravagant are made out of real gold.<br><br>In most Sanist faiths, adherents are not permitted to wear golden vials until formally entering the faith through a blood gifting ceremony. This is a consensual act in many Sanist groups, but harder sects like the Sarikusans of the Blood Raiders may refuse to allow adherents to join the faith or wear vials until they have taken blood by force. Various adornments may be added to a worshipper's vial as they develop in their faith, or they may take to wearing multiple vials. The loss of a vial is considered a severe setback in a Sanist's spiritual journey, though a Sanist may gift a vial to others in certain circumstances.<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, most golden vials do not actually contain any blood. Blood, or a blood substitute, may still be rubbed on the vial during religious ceremonies, but it is usually washed off following the event. The blood raiders are an exception to this, and instead end their functions by anointing their vials with protective coatings of varnish to preserve any blood stains.</td>

If only we rise.<br><br>They won't teach you that part of Scripture in the Empire. Whether you are Minmatar or whether you are Ealur, or whether you are Ni-Kunni or even whether you are some common-blooded True Amarr, if you are not one of them in power they do not want you to know that. Because they do not want you to be one of them. They do not want to have to share that power. They don't want to share that power with you. But is that God's will? <br><br>Is that what God wants from us? No! You are equal in my kingdom! That is what God says! Whether you are Minmatar or Ealur or Ni-Kunni or True Amarr, you are all His creation! You have to rise. If you keep submitting then that's all you're ever going to do. That's all you're ever going to be. That's not what God wants. That is not what God wants.<br><br>Rise. Reclaim yourself. You are powerful not because you were born that way or because your family has a lot of money or because someone gave it to you. You are powerful because you are you. You are God's Chosen. We are all God's Chosen. As long as we choose to be. We have to choose to rise."</i><br><br>– Transcript of a sermon given to worshippers by the Sani Sabik priest Sharham Kaholan, an Ealur.</td>

		<td>49649 - <b>Lifeblood (Collector's Edition)</b></td>
		<td style="max-width: 500px;">Sani Sabik sects are found throughout New Eden, many with significantly different belief systems from that of the Blood Raider Covenant's Sarikusan sect. When compared to the Covenant, Sani Sabik worshippers found in places like the Federation can be considerably softer, exchanging blood freely with other worshippers instead of forcibly bleeding captives. Sanist worship in the Federation has risen steadily over the last decade, with many attributing its growing popularity to the famous music star, Midna Lyre, who produces Sani Sabik-themed music.<br><br>Lifeblood was Midna Lyre's breakout album into the genre of Sanist music, which had until then only been found in amateur music produced for Galnet media sites and Sanist subgroups. The controversy surrounding the album secured Midna the number one spot on Egonics' Top Albums of YC110 list, with singles like, "Night Box," and "I Wanna Taste You (Bleed for Me)". Midna has gone on to produce many more Sani Sabik-themed songs, and a compilation album of her greatest hits titled, "The Red Album," is due for release in mid YC121.<br><br>Several attempts have been made to ban sales of Lifeblood and other Sani Sabik music. This activism has not seen much success in the Federation, but in the Amarr Empire possession of Sanist music, including anything produced by Midna (Sani Sabik or not), is grounds for arrest and charges of heresy.</td>

Upon death, numerous Sani preachers would be sealed in these airtight coffins and locked away to prevent practitioners from recovering bodies for ritual purposes.<br><br>While the device is rarely, if ever used by the Amarr Empire these days, in typical Blood Raider fashion the Covenant now uses the examples in its possession on any Amarr priests or heretic hunters that fall into their hands.</td>
