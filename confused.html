<p>Hoboleaks is meant as lightweight* comparison website for both TQ -> SISI as well as SISI -> Chaos. You can also see what changed in specific revisions (currently I only display the last 10). Navigate through the pages by using the menu at the top of the site. The website will auto update within a few minutes of each patch (usually), and you may need to do a cache-less refresh (CTRL+F5) to see changes immediately when that happens.<br><br>I have only verified the basic functionality of the website in Chrome or Firefox. If you use a different browser, don't worry, it's pretty shit on Chrome & Firefox as well.</p>
