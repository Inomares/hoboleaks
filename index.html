		<td style="max-width: 250px;">59980 - <b>Order of St. Tetrimon Fortress Monastery</b></td>
		<td style="max-width: 400px;"><i>This heavily fortified monastery serves as a regional chapterhouse for the Order of St. Tetrimon in Domain. As a major base for this powerful religious and military order, it is defended by fanatical followers of the Tetrimon's radical scriptural, theocratic, and militarist doctrines.<br><br>The construction of this fortress monastery within the Thebeka system was made possible by Royal Heir Arim Ardishapur who sees the Tetrimon as valuable allies on the politically conservative and religiously militant side of the struggle for the future of the Amarr Empire. Order of St. Tetrimon military forces were involved in putting down a number of slave rebellions in Ardishapur domains, including a major uprising in the Thebeka system. The construction of this fortress monastery in the system marks that service and underlines the political alliance between House Ardishapur and the Order.<br><br>Although the monastery is officially sanctioned by the local Ardishapur authorities, many observers have noted the Order's choice to construct their facility at the very outer reaches of the Thebeka system, far from the populated inner planets and public space stations. This choice of location is viewed as a clear signal that the Order of St. Tetrimon continues to see itself standing apart from the temporal politics of the Empire, with its mission distinct, deeply spiritual, and remaining fully inspired by the example of St. Tetrimon.</i><br><br>The Order was founded in 21460 AD in the name of St. Tetrimon, an Ardishapur noble who assassinated his grandfather the Emperor Zaragram II, in response to the increasingly megalomaniac and heretical actions of the "Mad Emperor". The Order of St. Tetrimon was tasked by the Council of Apostles with the role of preserving the original Amarr Scriptures and purging all apocryphal and non-canon texts, which included the majority of Zaragram II’s decrees. This mission later brought the Order into tension with the dominant powers of the Amarr Empire during the era of the "Moral Reforms" that began in 21875 AD. This tension grew until 22762 AD, when the Order of St. Tetrimon was officially suppressed by the Imperial authorities. Surviving members of the Order fled to the Khanid Kingdom where they received political protection.<br><br>During this time in exile, the Order of St. Tetrimon worked to increase their martial strength and increased their militarism to ensure that they would be able to defend their beliefs if another conflict erupted. This served them well when the Minmatar Rebellion began in 23216 AD. The Order reached an agreement with Emperor Heideran VII as Amarr forces were overstretched by the spreading rebellion. The Order would be allowed to once again travel through the Empire freely in return for assistance against Minmatar forces. In subsequent decades, ships flying Tetrimon colours became much feared by the young Republic Fleet for their fearless attacks and the suicidal fury shown by their pilots.<br><br>During the remaining reign of Heideran VII the Tetrimon were left untouched, on the understanding that they would not attempt to undermine Emperor's authority. The agreement did not survive under Heideran's successor Doriam II, a ruler with liberal views and a history of releasing slaves. Increasing conflict with the Theology Council during Doriam II's YC105-107 reign led to the Order of St. Tetrimon being suppressed once more following a political struggle that involved several Royal Houses and even capsuleers. Returning to their secluded fastnesses in the Khanid Kingdom and beyond, the Order remained relatively quiescent during the Karsoth Interregnum, building its strength and continuing its mission.<br><br>Following the Elder Fleet Invasion of the Amarr Empire in YC110, and the return and coronation of Empress Jamyl I, the Order of St. Tetrimon welcomed the new Amarr ruler and pledged its continuing fealty to the Holy Amarr Empire. Upon the death of Empress Jamyl I in YC117, the Order returned to the Empire as a neutral arbiter and guardian of the Imperial Succession process, in an Empire that had become deeply factionalized and corrupted by "Red Chamberlain" Dochuta Karsoth's rule.<br><br>During the rule of Empress Catiz I, the fortunes of the Order of St. Tetrimon have continued to improve. Under the leadership of Grand Master Khemon Dulsur an-Tetrimon, the Order has established a role as a force useful for seeking out and suppressing rebellion and heresy. Increasing conflict across New Eden has revitalized the "Religious Reclaimer" tendency among the Amarr Empire's powerful nobility and brought support for the Order. Militant and conservative houses such as the Ardishapur and Sarum have forged cordial relations with the Tetrimon, in an Amarr Empire with royal houses, powerful ministries, and religious factions carefully balanced against one another by a relatively new Empress.</td>

		<td style="max-width: 250px;">59981 - <b>The Traumark Installation</b></td>
		<td style="max-width: 400px;">The Traumark Installation is a massive fortress complex that stands as a sentinel overlooking the southern reaches of the Amarr Empire and the border between the Empire and Sansha's Nation. The history of this installation tells a story of pride, folly, and resurgence for the vastly rich Tash-Murkon royal family.<br><br>The original Traumark Installation was constructed by the Tash-Murkon family during the first optimistic century following their elevation to the top echelons of power within the Amarr Empire after the Khanid Rebellion. It was designed to defend the southernmost point of the Tash-Murkon royal territory and to attract attention as a symbol of the family's commitment to progress and development. The old Traumark Installation stood for over two hundred years as a shining symbol of Tash-Murkon wealth and might. Yet that proud moment came and went as the fortress, once thought to be impregnable, fell into the hands of Sansha's Nation during the Nation's first great resurgence in YC105. All efforts to retake the installation failed, and the infested ruins stood for over a decade as a thorn in the side of the proud but humbled Tash-Murkons.<br><br>Eventually the pragmatic Tash-Murkons decided to take a different approach and instead of recapturing the Sansha-infested ruins of Old Traumark they began constructing a new Traumark Installation at a new location not far from the previous site. Royal Heir Tunir Tash-Murkon and his advisors shrewdly took advantage of an influx of surplus equipment available to the empires with the reduction in the intensity of the EDENCOM/Triglavian conflict in YC123. Using the equipment and resources they had acquired, the Tash-Murkon Family was able to build the new Traumark Installation well below projected budgets.<br><br>Additionally, the influence of the Tash-Murkon with Empress Catiz I, and their successful lobbying for a new stargate to Stain region, ensured that their new fortress would be a short warp away from the Empire's newly-constructed link between Samnier and F7-ICZ. The new installation serves both as a defensive bulwark against Sansha intrusion into Amarr space, and as a hub for the Tash-Murkon family's military, exploration, and resource gathering expeditions into Stain.</td>

		<td style="max-width: 250px;">59982 - <b>Old Traumark</b></td>
		<td style="max-width: 400px;">The Old Traumark Installation was formerly a massive fortress guarding the southern space territories of the vastly rich Tash-Murkon royal family. At its height it represented the proudest moment in the history of the Tash-Murkon and a symbol of their commitment to progress and development. Yet that proud moment came and went, for the fortress, once thought to be impregnable, fell into the hands of Sansha's Nation<br><br>Over the subsequent years several attempts were made to recapture and renovate the installation, however each attempt was stymied by the entrenched Sansha forces. The close proximity to Stain allowed Nation reinforcements to arrive with little warning, and the stations themselves were riddled with booby traps and infested by numerous cybernetically-augmented True Slave soldiers.<br><br>After these failed attempts to recapture the ruins, the pragmatic Tash-Murkons eventually changed their approach and chose to build a new Traumark Installation at a nearby location. Now two versions of the great southern fortress exist just a short warp away from each other: a bright shining facility that represents the best of Amarr progress and might, and the ruined fortification that serves as an ever-present reminder of that might's limits.</td>

		<td style="max-width: 250px;">59983 - <b>Ndoria Mining Hub</b></td>
		<td style="max-width: 400px;">The moons of the planet Ndoria, in the system of Uplingur, have long been a focus for tensions between the Minmatar Republic and the Ammatar Mandate, a satellite state of the greater Amarr Empire. Uplingur is located on the border of Minmatar and Ammatar space, and for many years was claimed by both governments. With both Republic and Mandate focused on the security of key systems during the long Vindication Wars, neither were willing to go beyond mere words and assert their claims in substance. This changed in YC104, two years after the cessation of hostilities between the Republic and Mandate, when military and logistical support from the Amarr Empire enabled the Ammatar to assert control of the system.<br><br>Seizing this opportunity, the Mandate-based Nefantar Miner Association moved into Uplingur in force and began constructing infrastructure to exploit Uplingur's rich resources. The 22 moons of the planet Ndoria contained huge deposits of several highly valuable minerals and had been coveted for years by all the empires.

		<td style="max-width: 400px;">The moons of the planet Ndoria, in the system of Uplingur, have long been a focus for tensions between the Minmatar Republic and the Ammatar Mandate, a satellite state of the greater Amarr Empire. Uplingur is located on the border of Minmatar and Ammatar space, and for many years was claimed by both governments. With both Republic and Mandate focused on the security of key systems during the long Vindication Wars, neither were willing to go beyond mere words and assert their claims in substance. This changed in YC104, two years after the cessation of hostilities between the Republic and Mandate, when military and logistical support from the Amarr Empire enabled the Ammatar to assert control of the system.<br><br>Seizing this opportunity, the Mandate-based Nefantar Miner Association moved into Uplingur in force and began constructing infrastructure to exploit Uplingur's rich resources.

But that</ins><span> moment came and went </span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">as</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">when</ins><span> the fortress, once thought to be impregnable, fell into the hands of Sansha's Nation</span><del style="background:#ffe6e6;"> during the Nation's first great resurgence in YC105. All efforts to retake the installation failed, and the infested ruins stood for over a decade as a thorn in the side of the proud but humbled Tash-Murkons.<br><br>Eventually the pragmatic Tash-Murkons decided to take a different approach and instead of recapturing the Sansha-infested ruins of Old Traumark they began constructing a new Traumark Installation at a new location not far from the previous site. Royal Heir Tunir Tash-Murkon and his advisors shrewdly took advantage of an influx of surplus equipment available to the empires with the reduction in the intensity of the EDENCOM/Triglavian conflict in YC123. Using the equipment and resources they had acquired, the Tash-Murkon Family was able to build the new Traumark Installation well below projected budgets.<br><br>Additionally, the influence of the Tash-Murkon with Empress Catiz I, and their successful lobbying for a new stargate to Stain region, ensured that their new fortress would be a short warp away from the Empire's newly-constructed link between Samnier and F7-ICZ. The new installation serves both as a defensive bulwark against Sansha intrusion into Amarr space, and as a hub for the Tash-Murkon family's military, exploration, and resource gathering expeditions into Stain</del><ins style="background:#e6ffe6;">. All efforts to retake the installation have failed and today it stands as a thorn in the side of the proud, but humbled, Tash-Murkons</ins><span>.</span></td>

		<td style="width:355px;">The Traumark Installation is a massive fortress complex that stands as a sentinel overlooking the southern reaches of the Amarr Empire and the border between the Empire and Sansha's Nation. The history of this installation tells a story of pride, folly, and resurgence for the vastly rich Tash-Murkon royal family.<br><br>The original Traumark Installation was constructed by the Tash-Murkon family during the first optimistic century following their elevation to the top echelons of power within the Amarr Empire after the Khanid Rebellion. It was designed to defend the southernmost point of the Tash-Murkon royal territory and to attract attention as a symbol of the family's commitment to progress and development. The old Traumark Installation stood for over two hundred years as a shining symbol of Tash-Murkon wealth and might. Yet that proud moment came and went as the fortress, once thought to be impregnable, fell into the hands of Sansha's Nation during the Nation's first great resurgence in YC105. All efforts to retake the installation failed, and the infested ruins stood for over a decade as a thorn in the side of the proud but humbled Tash-Murkons.<br><br>Eventually the pragmatic Tash-Murkons decided to take a different approach and instead of recapturing the Sansha-infested ruins of Old Traumark they began constructing a new Traumark Installation at a new location not far from the previous site. Royal Heir Tunir Tash-Murkon and his advisors shrewdly took advantage of an influx of surplus equipment available to the empires with the reduction in the intensity of the EDENCOM/Triglavian conflict in YC123. Using the equipment and resources they had acquired, the Tash-Murkon Family was able to build the new Traumark Installation well below projected budgets.<br><br>Additionally, the influence of the Tash-Murkon with Empress Catiz I, and their successful lobbying for a new stargate to Stain region, ensured that their new fortress would be a short warp away from the Empire's newly-constructed link between Samnier and F7-ICZ. The new installation serves both as a defensive bulwark against Sansha intrusion into Amarr space, and as a hub for the Tash-Murkon family's military, exploration, and resource gathering expeditions into Stain.</td>

As a major base for this powerful religious and military order, it is defended by fanatical followers of the Tetrimon's radical scriptural, theocratic, and militarist doctrines.<br><br>The construction of this fortress monastery within the Thebeka system was made possible by Royal Heir Arim Ardishapur who sees the Tetrimon as valuable allies on the politically conservative and religiously militant side of the struggle for the future of the Amarr Empire. Order of St. Tetrimon military forces were involved in putting down a number of slave rebellions in Ardishapur domains, including a major uprising in the Thebeka system. The construction of this fortress monastery in the system marks that service and underlines the political alliance between House Ardishapur and the Order.<br><br>Although the monastery is officially sanctioned by the local Ardishapur authorities, many observers have noted the Order's choice to construct their facility at the very outer reaches of the Thebeka system, far from the populated inner planets and public space stations. This choice of location is viewed as a clear signal that the Order of St. Tetrimon continues to see itself standing apart from the temporal politics of the Empire, with its mission distinct, deeply spiritual, and remaining fully inspired by the example of St. Tetrimon.</i><br><br>The Order was founded in 21460 AD in the name of St. Tetrimon, an Ardishapur noble who assassinated his grandfather the Emperor Zaragram II, in response to the increasingly megalomaniac and heretical actions of the "Mad Emperor". The Order of St. Tetrimon was tasked by the Council of Apostles with the role of preserving the original Amarr Scriptures and purging all apocryphal and non-canon texts, which included the majority of Zaragram II’s decrees. This mission later brought the Order into tension with the dominant powers of the Amarr Empire during the era of the "Moral Reforms" that began in 21875 AD. This tension grew until 22762 AD, when the Order of St. Tetrimon was officially suppressed by the Imperial authorities. Surviving members of the Order fled to the Khanid Kingdom where they received political protection.<br><br>During this time in exile, the Order of St. Tetrimon worked to increase their martial strength and increased their militarism to ensure that they would be able to defend their beliefs if another conflict erupted. This served them well when the Minmatar Rebellion began in 23216 AD. The Order reached an agreement with Emperor Heideran VII as Amarr forces were overstretched by the spreading rebellion. The Order would be allowed to once again travel through the Empire freely in return for assistance against Minmatar forces. In subsequent decades, ships flying Tetrimon colours became much feared by the young Republic Fleet for their fearless attacks and the suicidal fury shown by their pilots.<br><br>During the remaining reign of Heideran VII the Tetrimon were left untouched, on the understanding that they would not attempt to undermine Emperor's authority. The agreement did not survive under Heideran's successor Doriam II, a ruler with liberal views and a history of releasing slaves. Increasing conflict with the Theology Council during Doriam II's YC105-107 reign led to the Order of St. Tetrimon being suppressed once more following a political struggle that involved several Royal Houses and even capsuleers. Returning to their secluded fastnesses in the Khanid Kingdom and beyond, the Order remained relatively quiescent during the Karsoth Interregnum, building its strength and continuing its mission.<br><br>Following the Elder Fleet Invasion of the Amarr Empire in YC110, and the return and coronation of Empress Jamyl I, the Order of St. Tetrimon welcomed the new Amarr ruler and pledged its continuing fealty to the Holy Amarr Empire. Upon the death of Empress Jamyl I in YC117, the Order returned to the Empire as a neutral arbiter and guardian of the Imperial Succession process, in an Empire that had become deeply factionalized and corrupted by "Red Chamberlain" Dochuta Karsoth's rule.<br><br>During the rule of Empress Catiz I, the fortunes of the Order of St. Tetrimon have continued to improve. Under the leadership of Grand Master Khemon Dulsur an-Tetrimon, the Order has established a role as a force useful for seeking out and suppressing rebellion and heresy. Increasing conflict across New Eden has revitalized the "Religious Reclaimer" tendency among the Amarr Empire's powerful nobility and brought support for the Order. Militant and conservative houses such as the Ardishapur and Sarum have forged cordial relations with the Tetrimon, in an Amarr Empire with royal houses, powerful ministries, and religious factions carefully balanced against one another by a relatively new Empress.</td>
