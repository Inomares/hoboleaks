		<td style="width:355px;"><del style="background:#ffe6e6;">The Caldari State Police is one of the few law enforcement organizations that conducts operations across Caldari territory, working alongside Caldari Customs and the Business Tribunal Audit &amp; Investigation Branch, known as the "Audit Tribunes". Originating as the planetary police force of Caldari Prime, during the period of Caldari membership of the Federation, the Caldari Police Guards played a key role in evacuating millions during the Caldari-Gallente War. This guaranteed the continued existence of the agency as the Caldari State Police, even in the new Caldari order of a fully corporate state.<br><br>The Caldari State Police found its niche in the interstellar nature of the Caldari State and is often used by the many smaller corporations and multistellar businesses that require a law enforcement agency that can operate across megacorporate territorial lines. The bulk of the State Police's income is derived from such policing and security work, but it retains Chief Executive Panel funding and the "Big 8" oversight that comes with it. Occasionally, the megacorporations may call in the State Police to resolve some matter they wish to keep at arms length. Actual disputes between megacorps remain the almost exclusive preserve of the CBT and its Audit Tribunes.</del></td>
