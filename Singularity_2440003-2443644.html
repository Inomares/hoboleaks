		<td style="max-width: 400px;">Auroras, or polar lights, are a universal concept and shared experience among the peoples of New Eden. The heavily-populated terrestrial home planets are particularly noted for stories and myths involving these striking, dancing lights in the sky.<br><br>To the Amarr, the aurora are linked to ancient religious stories and are sometimes known as "Sefrim Banners", alluding to the angelic figures considered messengers from God. A tradition of the appearance of these lights heralding divine approval for the armies of Amarr during the Reclaiming of Athra is well attested.<br><br>For the Caldari, the polar lights are the enigmatic "Flame Wind", a mysterious force in the animistic mythology of Caldari Prime's pre-industrial era. On the cold Caldari home world, the appearance of the aurora was associated with unusual weather and sudden migrations of animals.<br><br>The various nations of Gallente Prime had their ancient legends about polar lights but knew the aurora to be an interaction of atmosphere, magnetic fields and stellar winds from the time of the "Airship Wars". Viewing aurora on airship trips to the polar regions of Gallente Prime is a popular tourist activity on the planet.<br><br>The Minmatar have a somewhat mixed viewpoint on aurora with some believing that such lights were seen during the storms that wracked Matar during the "Day of Darkness" that heralded the Amarr invasion. Most think this notion mixes up the fragmentary tales of what happened in those times and the traditional view of the polar lights, at least for tribes such as the Brutor and Sebiestor, is that they represent a "standing place gathering" or moot of tribal spirits.<br><br>At the time of the Yoiul Festival, the aurora lights of the worlds of New Eden are one reminder of the shared history of the people of the cluster and have becomes a symbol to some of their universal connections with one another.</td>

Many cultures consider these dramatic displays in the skies of their planets to be awe-inspiring and dramatic, and they are the source of much myth and art. <br>In some cases, extreme aurora activity can be a portent of impending disaster, and increased or even extreme stellar activity can indeed wreak havoc on inhabited planets. Even so, the Luminae Polaris nanocoating celebrates the more attractive and inspiring side of these dramatic phenomena.</td>

		<td style="max-width: 400px;">The Guristas Pirates are attempting to steal the valuable HISC-99 fuel being refined by ORE at this location. While an assault on the Ice Refinery is impractical and would be likely to result in an explosion capable of destroying everything in the vicinity, the special Automated HISC-99 Tankers the facility uses to ferry the fuel to a loading dock can be hacked and hijacked without too much difficulty.<br><br>The pirates have a heavily-modified, suitably-shielded freighter on standby and are using this improvised scaffold to load the stolen HISC-99 fuel into their pirate supertanker. Any automated tankers hijacked by pirate capsuleers are to be guided to this location for pickup by the Guristas Pirates.</td>

Many cultures consider these dramatic displays in the skies of their planets to be awe-inspiring and dramatic, and they are the source of much myth and art.<br>In some cases, extreme aurora activity can be a portent of impending disaster, and increased or even extreme stellar activity can indeed wreak havoc on inhabited planets. Even so, the Luminae Polaris nanocoating celebrates the more attractive and inspiring side of these dramatic phenomena.</ins></td>
