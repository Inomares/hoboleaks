Such preparations are intended for use in traditional Vherokior mysticism but have become popular among Minmatar and Gallente youth.<br><br>These herbs are not distributed commercially, but are rather provided in various specialty mixes by Vherokior apothecaries on both sides of the border. The Vherokior ask no questions of those wishing to use the herb preparations, reasoning that the use of their mixes to enter altered states of consciousness is a personal matter.</td>

		<td>48587 - <b>Dice of Jade</b></td>
		<td style="max-width: 500px;">The Jade Coast of Matar, named so because of its vibrant green mineral sands, actually produces a considerable amount of the ornamental material in the alluvial deposits of the Tronhadar river delta that is a dominant feature of the local geography. Long ago, in the ancient past of Minmatar, the hard-wearing jade would be used as a material for tools as well as ornamental objects. <br><br>Today, the Jade Coast serves as an ideal vacation destination, and many casinos operate along it beaches and on the placid waters of the delta. Jade dice are staple curios of such casinos, although tourists are advised to seek only games where transparent polymer dice are being used.</td>

		<td>48588 - <b>Krusual Etched Sticks</b></td>
		<td style="max-width: 500px;">These sticks, to the untrained eye, appear to be nothing more than twigs bereft of bark and chewed upon by hungry bugs. However, the Krusual Tribe used sticks such as these to communicate secretly under the paranoid eyes of their Amarr overseers. <br><br>A combination of vertical and horizontal lines, occasionally intersected by curves or sharp angles, represents a fiercely guarded nonverbal language. Academics speculate the source of such a language could be traced back to hunts in the Tronhadar Valley region, where scouts would leave carved sticks on the trail for the main hunting party to read.</td>

		<td>48589 - <b>Matari Word Calendar</b></td>
		<td style="max-width: 500px;">Many Minmatar still speak Amarish as their first language, particularly since the return of the Nefantar and Starkmanir,  and all tribes are concerned to address this cultural issue. (Though the suggestion from the Krusual that all Minmatar adopt their tribal language, which remains almost entirely intact due to the Krusual resistance, was politely declined by the other tribes when the Republic was founded.)<br><br>Therefore major efforts are underway within the Republic to recover what is possible of all historical tribal languages and dialects, so as to restore them for use in modern Minmatar societies. This calendar comes from an industry born out of that sentiment. There's a new Matari word for each of the 1357 days of the Matar year!</td>

		<td style="max-width: 500px;">Kri’taks are combat knives commonly used by Minmatar, based off a traditional Sebiestor ice pick called the ci’nal. Ci’nals were used by northern Sebiestor clans to break apart ice, though only a few clans still use them since the development of high-tech cutters and refrigeration units. Kri’taks retain the stiletto shape of the original ci’nal, but their blade is broadened and edged.<br><br>Kri’taks have become a standard weapon for Valklear Special Forces. Like the nova knives used by planetside armies and clone mercenaries, Valklear kri’taks have rapidly-oscillating edges that greatly enhance the knife’s ability to cut through dense material.</td>

		<td>48593 - <b>Slaver Tooth Necklace</b></td>
		<td style="max-width: 500px;">This cord of yellowish fangs is typical of many with a claimed history of being the spoils from raids on Amarr slave camps, the story going that the necklace is formed of teeth from the Slaver Hounds killed during such raids.<br><br>Far from the effects of decay, the teeth have not fared well since parting with their owner. A scattering of little notch marks suggests they were forcibly removed – perhaps hurriedly or the creature they came from was in its death throes at the time. (The idea that anyone would try to remove the teeth from a Slaver Hound short of being mortally wounded seems far-fetched.)<br><br>The varying sizes of the teeth offer little clue to whether they came from one creature or many. However, their immense length, some as long as seven centimeters, does indeed point to the Amarr slaveholders' favored Syrikos Hound as a likely source.</td>
