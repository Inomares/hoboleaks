		<td style="max-width: 500px;">The Great Rebellion was the dawn of liberation for the Minmatar tribes that once lived almost entirely under the dominion of the Amarr. When the slave revolt broke out in 20 BYC (AD 23216), it stunned an Amarr Empire already reeling from the shock of their defeat by the Jovian fleet at the Battle of Vak'Atioth.<br><br>The Minmatar that rose up were quickly able to cut a swathe through the territories surrounding the Matari home worlds, aided by groups of free Minmatar who had long operated as guerilla fighters both planet-side and in space. The Minmatar Republic was founded by four of the great tribes and was invited to join in the foundation of CONCORD in 3 BYC.

When the slave revolt broke out in 20 BYC (AD 23216), it stunned an Amarr Empire already reeling from the shock of their defeat by the Jovian fleet at the Battle of Vak'Atioth.<br><br>The Minmatar that rose up were quickly able to cut a swathe through the territories surrounding the Matari home worlds, aided by groups of free Minmatar who had long operated as guerilla fighters both planet-side and in space. The Minmatar Republic was founded by four of the great tribes and was invited to join in the foundation of CONCORD in 3 BYC.

When the slave revolt broke out in 20 BYC (AD 23216), it stunned an Amarr Empire already reeling from the shock of their defeat by the Jovian fleet at the Battle of Vak'Atioth.<br><br>The Minmatar that rose up were quickly able to cut a swathe through the territories surrounding the Matari home worlds, aided by groups of free Minmatar who had long operated as guerilla fighters both planet-side and in space.

		<td style="max-width: 500px;">An instrument of liberation, most strikingly known as a weapon to crush the heads of slavers and a tool to break the chains of slaves, the Khumaak is celebrated as the symbol of the Great Rebellion and Minmatar freedom from Amarr domination.<br><br>The Khumaak (literally "Hand of Maak") is a replica of an ancient Amarrian relic used over 400 years ago by the Minmatar slave Drupar Maak to kill his master, Arkon Ardishapur, on Arzad II. The legend says that Maak was inspired in his struggle for freedom by a vision of Holder Arzad, an Amarr noble who had treated his Starkmanir subjects with dignity. Arzad is said to have told Maak: "The fire in our hearts burns for salvation, redemption, and grace. May the Word of God grant you the courage to save yourself and your people."<br><br>Maak's killing of the Ardishapur heir sparked a revolt on Arzad II, also known as Starkman Prime. The slaying of Arkon Ardishapur was met with the brutal crushing of the revolt and almost total annihilation of the Starkmanir Tribe by orbital bombardment. The Starkmanir Rebellion preceded the Great Rebellion by over 250 years but its impact is held by historians to have been a major factor in the development of the underground slave movements that would ultimately fight for their freedom in 20 BYC (AD 23216).</td>
