The legend says that Maak was inspired in his struggle for freedom by a vision of Holder Arzad, an Amarr noble who had treated his Starkmanir subjects with dignity. Arzad is said to have told Maak: "The fire in our hearts burns for salvation, redemption, and grace. May the Word of God grant you the courage to save yourself and your people."<br><br>Maak's killing of the Ardishapur heir sparked a revolt on Arzad II, also known as Starkman Prime. The slaying of Arkon Ardishapur was met with the brutal crushing of the revolt and almost total annihilation of the Starkmanir Tribe by orbital bombardment. The Starkmanir Rebellion preceded the Great Rebellion by over 250 years but its impact is held by historians to have been a major factor in the development of the underground slave movements that would ultimately fight for their freedom in 20 BYC (AD 23216).</td>
